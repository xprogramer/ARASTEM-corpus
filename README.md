# ARASTEM-corpus
ARASTEM is a new corpus dedicated to the Arabic stemming field, where it contains several documents containing grouped words which are semantically and morphologically related. Hence, the corpus was constructed manually by the full intervention of native Arabic speakers after collecting several texts from different Arabic discussion forums. Furthermore, it contains words belonging to the Standard Arabic, Dialectical Arabic and Modern Pseudo Arabic languages.
